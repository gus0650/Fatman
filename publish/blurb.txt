FATMAN is a stupid little game where an overweight dude bounces up and down on his butt, you have a gun with 6 bullets. Figure it out.

This game was created to make fun of a classmate and motivate him into going to the gym and losing some weight.

What can I say? It was the 90s and "college humor" was a thing.
