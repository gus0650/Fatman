FATMAN is a game where a dude bounces up and down on his big butt, and you have a gun with 6 bullets. 

It is a very intuitive game.

This game was created to prank a guy who was being nasty and had to be taught a lesson. I made copies on floppy disk and spread them around the schoolyard. Revenge is sweet!

What can I say? It was the 90s. Our hair was long and our brains were ... not in good shape.

This was first written in AmigaBASIC but later converted to Blitzbasic.
